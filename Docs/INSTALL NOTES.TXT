Installation Notes
===============================

iCherry Music Manager (Application) is a modified and rebranded version of Notpod, prepared for distribution with the iCherry media player. 

Please ensure you always back up your music library and other important files on your computer. Before continuing with this installation, please make sure you save any open files to prevent loss of data in case a computer reboot is necessary. It's always important to back up both your computer and portable devices.

The Application is distributed "as is", and the Application's developer or the producer and distributor of the iCherry media player takes no responsiblity for damages or lost files due to the use of the Application. If uncertain about proper use of the Application, please refer to the support website at http://www.notpod.com.

Before starting to use Notpod with your device, it should NOT contain any music files. This will ensure that the device is properly synchronized. Any music files on the device, in the configured music folder, will be deleted at first synchronization unless their name match one of the tracks you put in the playlist for the device.

Please make sure to visit http://www.notpod.com frequently to check for updates and stay tuned with the development status.

Thank you for choosing to use the Application. We hope you will enjoy using iTunes with your portable media device.
